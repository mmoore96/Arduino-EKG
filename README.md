# Arduino-EKG
### By: George Moore and Cory Yelverton

## This project consist of:
* Arduino Uno
* Breadboard
* Wiring and headers
* AD8232 EKG Module
* Electrode sensor pads (3M Red Dot)
* Three lead electrodes (3.5 mm jack)

## Functionality

### Provides Three basic functions:
* Capture ECG tracing (similar to lead I of a 12-lead ECG).
* Show a real time ECG tracing with BPM that can be used as a cardiac monitor.
* In-depth ECG interpretation using ECG data with minimal artifact.



## Scope:
* A relatively low-cost ECG that can be used by healthcare providers in third world Countries that lack resources.
* Also can be used by patients at home at the discretion of their physician.


## Software:
Arduino IDE (C code)
Processing IDE (Java)
MATLAB (ECG Interpretation)


## Improvements for the future:
Implementing more leads (12-lead EKG)
Digital filters to eliminate motion and/or baseline artifact
Implementing additional ECG algorithms for interpretation
Faster plotting speed in MATLAB

## Total Cost
* AD8232 EKG Module = $20.00
* Arduino Uno = $22.00
* Three lead electrodes (3.5 mm jack) = $5.00
* Electrode sensor pads (Pack of 100) = $14.00
* Wiring, breadboard, and headers = ~$11.00
* Arduino IDE  = FREE
* Processing IDE = FREE
* MATLAB Software = $100.00
* Total: ~$172.00 (excluding cost of a computer)
